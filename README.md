## 📌 Project Overview

The **NBA Draft Success Prediction Project** aims to create a state-of-the-art AI model that predicts the career potential of NBA draft picks. By analyzing physical, performance, and advanced metrics from draft years 1995 to present, this project strives to offer unprecedented insights to NBA teams, scouts, and sports analysts.

**Objectives**:
- Develop a **Career Potential Score** based on player statistics, measurements, and pre-draft evaluations.
- Provide **predictive insights** for draft picks to guide scouting and recruitment decisions.
- Create a scalable, data-driven foundation that could be extended to adjacent fields, such as fantasy sports and sports betting.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Data-Rich Analysis**: Utilizes data from multiple sources, capturing physical attributes, college stats, and advanced NBA metrics.
- **Neural Network-Based Model**: Implements a deep learning model trained on over 25 years of draft data.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with PostgreSQL and Python, optimized for handling large, historical datasets with potential for real-time updates.
- **Future Potential**: Designed for easy integration with betting analytics, fantasy sports, and player scouting applications.
