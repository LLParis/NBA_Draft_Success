Project Plan for NBA Draft Success Prediction
1. Define Objectives and Milestones
Goal: Build a predictive model that forecasts NBA draft success based on historical and modern metrics.
Primary Objectives:
Develop a Career Potential Score.
Build a data pipeline to collect, clean, and store NBA and draft data.
Implement predictive modeling (e.g., neural networks, ensemble models).
Create an interactive dashboard for visualization.
Secondary Objectives:
Integrate a real-time updating mechanism (e.g., EMA) for in-season adjustments.
Develop an API to serve predictions.
2. Outline Key Phases
Phase 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

Milestone 1: Set up PostgreSQL database with tables for player attributes, game stats, and draft data.
Milestone 2: Collect and import historical NBA and draft data (1995-present).
Milestone 3: Write ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts to automate data collection and cleaning.
Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Milestone 1: Conduct EDA in Jupyter notebooks to understand trends, distributions, and correlations.
Milestone 2: Identify key metrics that contribute to draft success and derive new features (e.g., per-game averages, scoring efficiency).
Phase 3: Modeling and Training

Milestone 1: Set up baseline models (e.g., linear regression, random forest) for benchmarking.
Milestone 2: Develop and train a neural network model for more sophisticated predictions.
Milestone 3: Implement model evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, accuracy) and tune hyperparameters.
Phase 4: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for Real-Time Updates

Milestone 1: Implement EMA to weight recent games more heavily in model predictions.
Milestone 2: Test EMAâ€™s impact on prediction accuracy and responsiveness.
Phase 5: Deployment and Visualization

Milestone 1: Create a Flask app with interactive dashboards for visualization and user access.
Milestone 2: Develop an API endpoint to serve predictions to external applications.
Phase 6: Documentation and Testing

Milestone 1: Document each part of the project, including data handling, model architecture, and API endpoints.
Milestone 2: Run tests on the database, model predictions, and API to ensure robustness.
